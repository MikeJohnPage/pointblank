\title{Table Transformer: slice a table with a slice point on a time column}
\usage{
tt_time_slice(
  tbl,
  time_column = NULL,
  slice_point = 0,
  keep = c("left", "right"),
  auto_arrange = FALSE,
  omit_missing = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl}{A table object to be used as input for the transformation. This
can be a data frame, a tibble, a \code{tbl_dbi} object, or a \code{tbl_spark} object.}

\item{time_column}{The time-based column that will be used as a basis for the
slicing. If no time column is provided then the first one found will be
used.}

\item{slice_point}{The location on the \code{time_column} where the slicing will
occur. This can either be a real number from \code{0} to \code{1}, an ISO 8601
formatted time string (as a date or a date-time), a \code{POSIXct} time, or a
\code{Date} object.}

\item{keep}{Which slice should be kept? The \code{"left"} side (the default)
contains data rows that are earlier than the \code{slice_point} and the
\code{"right"} side will have rows that are later.}

\item{auto_arrange}{Should the table be arranged by the \code{time_column} just
before slicing? This may be useful if the input \code{tbl} isn't ordered by the
\code{time_column}.}

\item{omit_missing}{Should rows with missing values in the \code{time_column} be
removed just before slicing? This might be useful in conjunction with
\code{auto_arrange = TRUE} and there is an expectation of missing values in
the \code{time_column} (i.e., sorting by a column with missing values will
result in the accumulation of rows with those missing values).}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} object.
}
\description{
With any table object containing date or date-time columns, any one of those
columns can be used to effectively slice the data in two with a
\code{slice_point}: and you get to choose which of those slices you want to keep.
