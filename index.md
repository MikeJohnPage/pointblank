<br />
With the **pointblank** package it‚Äôs really easy to methodically validate your
data whether in the form of data frames or as database tables. On top of the
validation toolset, the package gives you the means to provide and keep
up-to-date with the information that *defines* your tables.

For table *validation*, the *agent* object works with a large collection of
simple (yet powerful!) validation functions. We can enable much more
sophisticated validation checks by using custom expressions and also through
stepwise mutation of the target table (through something we call
`preconditions`).

Sometimes we want to maintain table *information* and update it when the table
goes through changes. For that, we can use an *informant* object + associated
functions to help define the metadata entries and present it in a way that suits
you.
